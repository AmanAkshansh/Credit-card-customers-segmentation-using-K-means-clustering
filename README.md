# Credit-card-customers-segmentation-using-K-means-clustering
This project requires segmentation of Active credit card holders of a credit card company to define their marketing strategy.

The sample dataset(CC GENERAL) summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables. 

# BUSINESS CONTEXT
The objective of this project is to develope a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy.

# TECHINIQUES USED:-

1. Advanced data preparation: Built an ‘enriched’ customer profile by deriving “intelligent” KPIs
  such as:
   Monthly average purchase and cash advance amount
   Purchases by type (one-off, installments)
   Average amount per purchase and cash advance transaction,
   Limit usage (balance to credit limit ratio),
   Payments to minimum payments ratio etc.
2. Advanced reporting: Used the derived KPIs to gain insight on the customer profiles.
3. Identification of the relationships/ affinities between services.
4. Factor Analysis: Applied factor analysis technique for variable reduction. 
5. Clustering: Applied K-means clustering algorithm to reveal the behavioural segments of credit card holders.
6. Identification of cluster characterisitics of the chosen cluster solution using detailed profiling.
7. Provided the strategic insights and implementation of strategies for the segments of chosen cluster solution.

The Excel file(Case study 1 - Segmentation) contains the descriptive stats of all the variables,detailed profiling sheet with all the results and insights.
